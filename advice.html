    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As a freshman, you won't take AP classes. This is totally fine.</li>
        <li>Most of your teachers will always do their best to help you. Let them know if you're struggling.</li>
        <li>Don't fall behind on homework - it's hard to catch up. Just set aside a little time every night to get your work done.</li>
        <li>As long as you keep up with homeworks and pay attention in class, you'll be fine.</li>
        <li>Start projects as soon as they're assigned. Time flies!</li> 
        <li>Stay organized. Tech will give you a planner - use it! Write down every homework and test.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting around the school</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Walk on the right side of hallways.</li>
        <li>Use the correct staircase if it's between periods.</li>
        <li>Move quickly.</li>
        <li>Don't block the hallways.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make as many friends as you can, in all your classes.</li>
        <li>Don't worry about college yet - just join clubs or teams that you genuinely want to join. This is also a great way to make friends.</li>
        <li>Take breaks for yourself and make sure you're doing things you enjoy outside of school.</li>
        <li>Talk to your big sib or counselor if you need specific advice. They're happy to help!</li>
        <li>The bathroom machines are usually empty, but the school nurse (4w22) always has pads if you need one.</li>
    </ul>
